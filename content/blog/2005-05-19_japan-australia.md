Dear "Kai's travel" subscribers,

A couple of you showed concern whilst this list was offline for the last
2 months, WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF YOU?

Sherbet.

Anyway, did Japan. Quite a story there which I could divulge only in
private, intoxicated.

Then I came back Thailand and lazed around on busy beaches in 30-plus
degrees.

Now I am in Melbourne, Australia er.. via Vietnam. 

It is a great city, albeit chilly. I had no money when I arrived, but
now I have a job. It was touch and go, I could have had to return to
Europe in spring...

I am staying with reluctant hosts who are friends of my sister. I bit
awkward. I heard them talking one night about the fear that they are
harbouring a social criminal. 

They are a nice couple though, the kind of people who waste money on
organic food and unplug their TV at night to save electricity.

Well, I hope this email works. I will post a bit more of an update with
graphic porn later.

You have been ever so patient this far,
