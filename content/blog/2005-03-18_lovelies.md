Hello my darlings from Vientiane Laos!

The big news is my best friend from High school has come out to finance the
rest of my travels. I hope he will enjoy himself in my company, although I am
not sure if he understands my deep probing understated humour I employ with the
natives.

Other big news is that my MSc thesis has been accepted! So I am graduated, so I
thought. Well not so fast Kai...

I have to some how do a test to prove I wrote the thesis. I don't know how the
hell I am going to do this without returning to Finland. This is quite the
dilemma for me and hence my sullen mood of late.

I am trying to get excited about hiking through some scorching mosquito
infested jungle in the North with Jamie.

Some awful pictures:
