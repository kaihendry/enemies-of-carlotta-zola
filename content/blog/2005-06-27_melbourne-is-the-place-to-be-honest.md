When I first arrived in Melbourne I was practically broke. Too many Thai
massages or something. My sister's friend Gaby and Craig unwillingly
hosted my for a couple of weeks in Richmond a suburb just south of
Melbourne.

As soon as I come across some money I moved out into a hostel and spent
my time at the state library.

I participated in the speakers corner talking about my travels and
thoughts on Islam and I play "street" chess.

Next event was moving in to apartment that promised Internet, but didn't
have it. Fortunately I live with Sean who is a chef. We're having scones
here:

had a gun.

Besides spending my time on Internet dating sites, I shop at the
Victorian market:

It's like the market in Kallio (Finland), but bigger.

I'm not gay yet, though I am borrowing my gay flatmate's clothes.

I might be getting fat, but in style sweeties.

I live right in the city CBD:

The "town house" I live currently live in feels like a youth detention
centre. I am planning to move out soon though. My flatmates say they're
happy to join me which is encouraging. Though I am think of moving to
Sydney, depending on how my work goes.
