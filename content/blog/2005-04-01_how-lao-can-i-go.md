Oh so much as happened since my last email. Unfortunately my server in Finland
has been offline so I could not email you. Computers suck!

Jamie and I had a great time in Lao. We managed a huge amount of back
breaking travelling in those 2 weeks. The peak must of been the 13 hour
3rd class wooden bench train ride returning to Bangkok. Oh my god that
was bad. The great things I remember about Lao was jumping into the
fantastic rivers (I think a dolphin bit me) and drinking BeerLao. :)
Thanks again to the newly subscribed Julia for hosting us in Vientiane.

Check out Jamie's pictures, if you have not already:

Jamie has kept a online forum diary which has more juicy details:

Coming back to Bangkok is a living nightmare. I wanted to get out and
earn some of those big bucks with that MSc of mine. Disturbingly, I
decided instead of going to Australia I should shoot for Kazakhstan,
especially after being inspired by the Krgy revolution nearby:

Visas are hell. There is no Kazakhstan embassy in Thailand. There might
be one in Malaysia, but the phone numbers I found do not work. There is
one in Japan and one in China. I perhaps should have just gone to China,
but then my favourite sister recommended Japan and oh no... ;)

I booked a non-refundable one-way ticket and last night I went to
Bangkok airport to be told I can't board the plane without an outbound
ticket. I blame the travel agent. I am not sure if he was incompetent or
just scamming me. ASSHOLE! :(

I am still going to Japan on the next flight, but now only next week and this
ticket now with the penalties have now ruined my finances. I can't afford the
Kazakhstan visa, let alone a journey to Kazakhstan.

But the plot thickens. Tonight I received wonderful news that a hasty extract
from my MSc thesis:

Has been accepted an IEEE Conference on Mobile Business in Sydney, Australia:

So my head is whirling now. I guess I should get my ass down to
Australia by July to present it. Life can be awful complicated
sometimes. I am in an awful (costly) tug match between Sydney and now a
very possible PhD and an amazing job in Kazakhstan.

Ok, Bangkok isn't so bad. I think my taste buds have developed an appreciation
for Thai cuisine. The "Pat Thai" is now a firm favourite of mine. Also you can
order a bowl of cooked mussels for one EURO! I've met up with my old Indian
travel mates Bjorn and Felix who doing a great job of keeping me entertained.

Tomorrow we're going to this Ko Phi Phi Island. Yes, "the Beach". :)
